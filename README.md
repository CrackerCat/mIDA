mIDA v1.0.10 - MIDL Decompiler for IDA

WHAT IS mIDA?

mIDA is an IDA plugin which extracts RPC interfaces and recreates
the associated IDL file.
mIDA supports inline, interpreted and fully interpreted server stubs.


INSTALLATION

Just copy mida.plw to your IDA plugin directory.


HOW TO USE IT?

mIDA only works with the Windows GUI version of IDA (5.2 or later).
The plugin can be launched via the plugin menu or by using the shortcut
CTRL+7.

mIDA displays each interface inside a separate list dialog box.
Each function can be edited or decompiled (right click).
Format string addresses must only be changed if you suspect that
mIDA does not use the correct entry.


NOTE: mIDA can save the output to a file instead of using windows
when the 'ofile' option is given.
